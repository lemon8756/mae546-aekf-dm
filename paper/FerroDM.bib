@article{Maurel2009,
abstract = {The measurement of an object's shape using projected fringe patterns needs a relation between the measured phase and the object's height. Among various methods, the Fourier transform profilometry proposed by Takeda and Mutoh [Appl. Opt.22, 3977-3982 (1983)] is widely used in the literature. Rajoub et al. have shown that the reference relation given by Takeda is erroneous [J. Opt. A. Pure Appl. Opt.9, 66-75 (2007)]. This paper follows from Rajoub's study. Our results for the phase agree with Rajoub's results for both parallel- and crossed-optical-axes geometries and for either collimated or noncollimated projection. Our two main results are: (i) we show experimental evidence of the error in Takeda's formula and (ii) we explain the error in Takeda's derivation and we show that Rajoub's argument concerning Takeda's error is not correct.},

@article{Morzinski2008,
abstract = {New concepts for astronomical adaptive optics are enabled by use of micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) deformable mirrors (DMs). Unlike traditional DMs now used in astronomical AO systems, MEMS devices are smaller, less expensive, and exhibit extraordinarily repeatable actuation. Consequently, MEMS technology allows for novel configurations, such as multi-object AO, that require open-loop control of multiple DMs. At the UCO/Lick Observatory Laboratory for Adaptive Optics we are pursuing this concept in part by creating a phase- to-voltage model for the MEMS DM.We model the surface deflection approximately by the thin-plate equation. Using this modeling technique, we have achieved open-loop control accuracy in the laboratory to ∼13–30 nm surface rms in response to ∼1–3 µm peak-to-valley commands, respectively. Next, high-resolution measurements of the displacement between actuator posts are compared to the homogeneous solution of the thin-plate equation, to verify the model's validity. These measurements show that the thin-plate equation seems a plausible approach to modeling deformations of the top surface down to lateral scales of a tenth actuator spacing. Finally, in order to determine the physical lower limit to which our model can be expected to be accurate, we conducted a set of hysteresis experiments with a MEMS. We detect only a sub-nanometer amount of hysteresis of 0.6±0.3 nm surface over a 160-volt loop. This complements our previous stability and position repeatability measurements, showing that MEMS DMs actuate to sub-nanometer precision and are hence controllable in open-loop.},

@article{Brossel1947,
abstract = {The interference taking place when a parallel beam of light is incident on a wedge with highly reflecting surfaces is studied theoretically, an approximation correct to the third order being used and non-normal incidence considered. In addition to the well known plane of fringe localization close to the wedge, there is an infinity of other planes where clearly resolved fringes are observed even at distances up to several metres from the interferometer. In most cases the spacing of the maximum is a sub-multiple of that given by the classical formula N$\lambda$ = 2t cos $\theta$, but if minor details are taken into account the fringe period is the same in all planes of localization. This phenomenon is repetitive at equal intervals along the optical axis. All the effects have been experimentally observed. The significance of two fringe-broadening terms in the analysis is explained with reference to practical cases and the importance of small gaps is stressed. The theory predicts that a similar repetitive law of non-classical fringe spacing should exist at large distances along the line of greatest slope of the wedge, i.e. at large gaps of a centimetre or more.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first-ever experimental evaluation of a closed-loop adaptive optics system based on a magnetic fluid deformable mirror (MFDM). MFDMs are a new type of wavefront correctors used in adaptive optics systems to compensate for complex optical aberrations. They have been found particularly suitable for ophthalmic imaging systems where they can be used to compensate for the aberrations in the eye that lead to blurry retinal images. However, their practical implementation in clinical devices requires effective methods to control the shape of their deformable surface. This paper presents one such control method which is based on an innovative technique used to linearize the response of the MFDM surface shape. The design of the controller is based on a DC-decoupled model of the multi-input multi-output system and on considering a decentralized PI controller. Experimental results showing the performance of the closed-loop system comprising the developed controller and a 19-channel prototype MFDM are presented.},

@article{Kasdin2003,
abstract = {In this paper we examine several different apodization approaches to achieving high-contrast imaging of extrasolar planets and compare different designs on a selection of performance metrics. These approaches are characterized by their use of the pupil's transmission function to focus the starlight rather than by masking the star in the image plane as in a classical coronagraph. There are two broad classes of pupil coronagraphs examined in this paper: apodized pupils with spatially varying transmission functions and shaped pupils, whose transmission values are either 0 or 1. The latter are much easier to manufacture to the needed tolerances. In addition to comparing existing approaches, numerical optimization is used to design new pupil shapes. These new designs can achieve nearly as high a throughput as the best apodized pupils and perform significantly better than the apodized square aperture design. The new shaped pupils enable searches of 50%-100% of the detectable region, suppress the star's light to below 10-10 of its peak value, and have inner working distances as small as 2.8l/D. Pupils are shown for terrestrial planet discovery using square, rectangular, circular, and elliptical apertures. A mask targeted at Jovian planet discovery is also presented, in which contrast is given up to yield greater throughput.},

Furthermore, reliance on the calibration accuracy of transducers used in phase-shifting interferometry can be reduced; and phase-retrieval errors (e.g., fringe print-through) introduced by uncalibrated fluctuations in the phase-shifting phase increments can be alleviated. The method operates deterministically and does not rely on iterative global error minimization.

@phdthesis{Groff2012,
abstract = {Detecting and characterizing extrasolar planets has become a very relevant field in Astrophysics. There are several methods to achieve this, but by far the most difficult and potentially most rewarding approach is direct imaging of the planets. Coronagraphs can be used to image the area surrounding a star with sufficient contrast to detect orbiting planets. However, coronagraphs exhibit an extreme sensitivity to optical aberrations which causes starlight to leak into the search area. To solve this problem we use deformable mirrors to correct the field, recovering a small search area of high contrast (commonly referred to as a "dark hole") where we can once again search for planets. These coronagraphs require focal plane wavefront control techniques to achieve the necessary contrast levels. These correction algorithms are iterative and the control methods require an estimate of the electric field at the science camera, which requires nearly all of the images taken for the correction. In order to maximize science time the amount of time required for correction must be minimized, which means reducing the number of exposures required for correction. Given the large number of images required for estimation, the ideal choice is to use fewer exposures to estimate the electric field. With a more efficient monochromatic estimation in hand, we also seek to apply this correction over as broad a bandwidth as possible. This allows us to spectrally characterize a target without having to repair the field for every wavelength. This thesis derives and demonstrates an optimal estimator that uses prior knowl- edge to create the estimate of the electric field. In this way we can optimally estimate the electric field by minimizing the number of exposures required to estimate under an error constraint. With an optimal estimator in place for monochromatic light, we also demonstrate a controller that can suppress the field over a bandwidth when provided with this monochromatic estimate.

abstract = {We evaluate in detail the stability requirements for a band-limited coronagraph with an inner working angle as small as 2 $\lambda$/D coupled to an off-axis, 3.8-m diameter telescope. We have updated our methodologies since presenting a stability error budget for the Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph mission that worked at 4 $\lambda$/D and employed an 8th-order mask to reduce aberration sensitivities. In the previous work, we determined the tolerances relative to the total light leaking through the coronagraph. Now, we separate the light into a radial component, which is readily separable from a planet signal, and an azimuthal component, which is easily confused with a planet signal. In the current study, throughput considerations require a 4th-order coronagraph. This, combined with the more aggressive working angle, places extraordinarily tight requirements on wavefront stability and opto-mechanical stability. We find that the requirements are driven mainly by coma that leaks around the coronagraph mask and mimics the localized signal of a planet, and pointing errors that scatter light into the background, decreasing SNR. We also show how the requirements would be relaxed if a low-order aberration detection system could be employed.},

By measuring the movement of sources at high magnification, we find that the length distribution of correct branch cuts needed to unwrap a phase-difference map is approximately Gaussian. This provides a theoretical justification for unwrapping with the set of branch cuts that minimizes the sum of squares of cut lengths.},

We present here our approach to "unwrapping" the 2pi ambiguities in the two-dimensional data set. We find that noise and geometrical radar layover corrupt our measurements locally, and these local errors can propagate to form global phase errors that affect the entire image. We show that the local errors, or residues, can be readily identified and avoided in the global phase estimation.

abstract = {The need for high dynamic range imaging is crucial in many astronomical fields, such as extra-solar planet direct detection, extra-galactic science and circumstellar imaging. Using a high quality coronograph, dynamic ranges of up to $10^{5}$ have been achieved. However the ultimate limitations of coronographs do not come from their optical performances, but from scattering due to imperfections in the optical surfaces of the collecting system. We propose to use a deformable mirror to correct these imperfections and decrease the scattering level in local regions called ``dark holes''. Using this technique will enable imaging of fields with dynamic ranges exceeding $10^8$. We show that the dark-hole algorithm results in a lower scattering level than simply minimizing the RMS figure error (maximum-strehl-ratio algorithm). The achievable scattering level inside the dark-hole region will depend on the number of mirror actuators, the surface quality of the telescope, the single-actuator influence function and the observing wavelength. We have simulated cases with a $37\times37$ deformable mirror using data from the {\it Hubble Space Telescope\/} optics without spherical aberrations and have demonstrated dark holes with rectangular and annular shapes. We also present a preliminary concept of a monolithic, fully integrated, high density deformable mirror which can be used for this type of space application.},

abstract = {A computer program was developed to compute the profile of multiple-beam Fizeau fringes and was tested against laboratory observations. By using the program as a tool for studying the behavior of the fringes, a simplified model of the fringe formation process was developed. The shifts of the fringes from their expected locations are caused primarily by a reduction in spatial frequency that is due to the oblique projection of the fringes onto the detector. The angle at which the fringes are inclined to the input beam of the interferometer may be calculated by using a phase law developed by Brossel [Proc. Phys. Soc. 59, 224 (1947)] and is independent of the reflectivity of the cavity. Once the orientations of the fringe planes and the detector are known, the fringe shifts may be calculated by using simple trigonometry. Although the absolute shift of a particular fringe may be an appreciable fraction of a fringe spacing, neighboring fringes have nearly identical shifts, making the relative fringe shift inconsequential. The finesse of the fringes may be increased by either tilting the Fizeau cavity or defocusing the detector optics. Unlike the tilt angle required to minimize the fringe shift, the tilt angle that maximizes the finesse is a strong function of the cavity reflectivity.},

@phdthesis{Abdul-Rahman2007,
abstract = {For many years the two-dimensional Fourier Fringe Analysis (FFA) technique has been regarded as a fast and reliable technique for the analysis of fringe patterns projected onto static objects. Today, two-dimensional FFA is seen as a fast and flexible method for processing fringe patterns of a dynamic object. But it is still inherently a two- dimensional approach, i.e. it deals with three-dimensional data (a video sequence) on the basis of regarding the data-set as a series of individual 2D images. The analysis of each 2D image is performed completely independently, no information from the previous images, or following images, is available at the time of processing the current image. In the case of dynamic objects, we need new powerful techniques capable of processing the whole video sequence at once, instead of seeing it as a series of disconnected two- dimensional images. Regarding the data as a single unit means involving all variations of the fringe pattern, in space and time, in the processing procedure. In other words, three-dimensional processing may give us great potential benefits by taking into account the time variation of the fringe pattern, which was previously ignored. The extension of the two-dimensional FFA technique into three-dimensions requires the extension of the current two-dimensional phase unwrapping algorithms into three- dimensional form. Phase unwrapping can be simply defined to be the process of solving the ambiguity problem caused by the fact that the absolute phase is typically wrapped into the interval (-$\pi$,$\pi$). Phase unwrapping is considered to be a real challenge in fringe pattern analysis and many other applications, even in its two-dimensional form. In this thesis, a novel three-dimensional FFA system has been implemented and used for demodulating fringe pattern sequences of dynamic objects. In addition, this thesis illustrates two novel three-dimensional phase unwrapping algorithms. The first algorithm attempts to find the best unwrapping path in the three-dimensional wrapped- phase volume. The second algorithm follows a best path approach to unwrap the phase volume, but takes into account the effect of singularity loops. Singularity loops are defined here as the source of noise that must be avoided during unwrapping. The two different algorithms have been tested on both simulated and real objects. The results show outstanding performance for these algorithms when unwrapping fringe volumes with very high levels of noise. This thesis also compares the performance of the proposed algorithms with other existing two-dimensional and three-dimensional phase unwrapping algorithms.},

The challenge is in designing an imaging system for high contrast. Even with a perfect coronagraph that modifies the point spread function to achieve high contrast, wavefront sensing and control is needed to correct the errors in the optics and generate a "dark hole." The high-contrast imaging laboratory at Princeton University is equipped with two Boston Micromachines Kilo-DMs. We review here an algorithm designed to achieve high contrast on both sides of the image plane while minimizing the stroke necessary from each deformable mirror (DM). This algorithm uses the first DM to correct for amplitude aberrations and uses the second DM to create a flat wavefront in the pupil plane. We then show the first results obtained at Princeton with this correction algorithm, and we demonstrate a symmetric dark hole in monochromatic light.},

The shape or intensity distribution of reflected interference fringes from an interferometer which involves the thin film as its front or incident surface is observed to undergo a cyclic change as the metal film increases in mass per unit area. The effect is studied throughout the visible spectrum for the metals Ag, Au, Al, Cu, and Cr, evaporated in such a manner as to form films of gradually increasing mass per unit area up to an equivalent thickness of 400 angstroms. The effect is sensitive to the rate of formation of the films, to effects of increased temperature of the substrate, and correlates with recent electron microscope observations on the stable form of thin films of these metals. Brief mention is made of the practical applications of the several types of reflection fringe intensity distributions which are possible, to current investigations of the mechanisms of slip and twinning in metal crystals.},

In this paper, we demonstrate extremely high strokes and interactuator strokes achievable by MLDMs which can be used in astronomical instrumentation. In particular, we consider the use of such a mirror to suggest an interesting application for the next generation of large telescopes. We present a prototype 91 actuator deformable mirror made of a magnetic liquid (ferrofluid). This mirror uses a technique that linearizes the response of such mirrors by superimposing a large and uniform magnetic field on the magnetic field produced by an array of small coils. We discuss experimental results that illustrate the performance of MLDMs. A most interesting application of MLDMs comes from the fact they could be used to correct the aberrations of large and lower optical quality primary mirrors held by simple support systems. We estimate basic parameters of the needed MLDMs, obtaining reasonable values.},

These correction algorithms are iterative and the control methods need an estimate of the electric field at the science camera, which requires nearly all of the images taken for the correction. The best way to make such algorithms the least disruptive to science exposures is to reduce the number required to estimate the field. We demonstrate a Kalman filter estimator that uses prior knowledge to create the estimate of the electric field, dramatically reducing the number of exposures required to estimate the image plane electric field while stabilizing the suppression against poor signal-to-noise. In addition to a significant reduction in exposures, we discuss the relative merit of this algorithm to estimation schemes that do not incorporate prior state estimate history, particularly in regard to estimate error and covariance. Ultimately the filter will lead to an adaptive algorithm which can estimate physical parameters in the laboratory for robustness to variance in the optical train.},

abstract = {As adaptive optics (AO) technology progresses, both wide-field and high-order wavefront correction systems be- come reachable. Deformable mirrors (DMs) in these advanced architectures must exhibit exemplary performance to give low wavefront error. Such DMs must be economically attainable, meet stroke as well as flatness require- ments, and show stable and repeatable actuation. Micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) deformable mirrors, undergoing testing and characterization in the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics (LAO) at the University of California at Santa Cruz, show promise on these fronts. In addition to requiring advanced deformable mirror technology, these progressive AO architectures require advanced DM control algorithms. We therefore present a formulation for accurate open-loop control of MEMS deformable mirrors. The electrostatic actuators in a discrete-actuator MEMS device are attached via posts to a thin reflective top plate. The plate itself can be well-modeled by the thin plate equation. The actuators, although nonlinear in their response to applied voltage and deformation, are independent of each other except through forces transmitted by the top plate and can be empirically modeled via a calibration procedure we will describe. In this paper we present the modeling and laboratory results. So far in the lab we have achieved open loop control to ∼15 nm accuracy in response to arbi- trary commands of ∼500 nm amplitude. Open-loop control enables a wealth of new applications for astronomical adaptive optics instruments, particularly in multi-object integral field spectroscopy, which we will describe.},
